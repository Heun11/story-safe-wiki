[[File:Motorboat at Kankaria lake.JPG|thumb|right|A recreational [[motorboat]] with an [[outboard motor]]]]

A '''boat''' is a [[watercraft]] of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a [[ship]], which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.

Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the [[whaleboat]], were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern [[Navy|naval]] terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutler|first=Thomas J.|date=October 2017|title=Bluejacket's Manual - Of Ships and Boats and . . .|url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2017/october/bluejackets-manual-ships-and-boats-and|journal=Naval History Magazine|volume=31|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. [[Canoe]]s have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. [[Fishing boat]]s vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. [[Pleasure boat|Pleasure craft]] used in [[boating|recreational boating]] include ski boats, [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon boats]], and [[sailboat]]s. [[House boat]]s may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. [[Lighter (barge)|Lighters]] are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|Lifeboat]]s have rescue and safety functions.

Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. [[rowboat]]s and [[pedalo|paddle boats]]), wind  (e.g. [[sailboat]]s), and [[Inboard motor|inboard]]/[[Outboard motor|outboard]] [[motor]]s (including [[gasoline engine|gasoline]], [[diesel engine|diesel]], and [[electric motor|electric]]).

==Types==
[[File:সারি সারি পাল তোলা নৌকা.jpg|thumb|right|Boats with sails in Bangladesh]]
{{main|List of boat types}}
Boats can be categorized by their means of propulsion. These divide into:
# Unpowered. This involves drifting with the tide or a river current.
# Powered by the crew-members on board, using [[Rowing|oars]], paddles or a [[Setting pole|punting]] pole or quant.
# Powered by [[sail]].
# Towed{{snd}}either by humans or animals from a river or canal bank (or in very shallow water, by walking on the sea or river bed) or by another vessel.
# Powered by [[Engines|machinery]], such as internal combustion engines, steam engines or by batteries and an electric motor.&lt;br&gt;Any one vessel may use more than one of these methods at different times or in combination.&lt;ref name="McGrail 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGrail |first1=Sean |title=Early ships and seafaring : European water transport |date=2014 |publisher=Pen and Sword Archaeology |location=South Yorkshire, England |isbn=9781781593929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

A number of large vessels are usually referred to as boats. [[Submarine]]s are a prime example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Chief of Naval Operations |author-link=Chief of Naval Operations |date=March 2001 |title=The Saga of the Submarine: Early Years to the Beginning of Nuclear Power |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/history/subsaga5.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114164154/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/history/subsaga5.html |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |access-date=2008-10-03 |publisher=United States Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of large vessels which are traditionally called boats include [[lake freighter|Great Lakes freighters]], [[riverboat]]s, and [[ferryboat]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=Charles Frederic |title=Utmost care to Watercourses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TlJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA440 |volume=28 |page=440 |year=1895 |editor-last=Merrill |editor-first=John Houston |series=The American and English Encyclopædia of Law |contribution=Vessel |publisher=Edward Thompson Company |editor2-last=Williams |editor2-first=Charles Frederic |editor3-last=Michie |editor3-first=Thomas Johnson |editor4-last=Garland |editor4-first=David Shephard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though large enough to carry their own boats and heavy cargoes, these vessels are designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.

==Terminology==
{{further|Glossary of nautical terms}}
The [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the main, and in some cases only, structural component of a boat.  It provides both capacity and [[buoyancy]]. The [[keel]] is a boat's "backbone", a lengthwise structural member to which the perpendicular frames are fixed. On some boats a [[deck (ship)|deck]] covers the hull, in part or whole. While a [[ship]] often has several decks, a boat is unlikely to have more than one. Above the deck are often [[Lifeline (safety)|lifelines]] connected to [[stanchion]]s, [[Bulwark (nautical)|bulwark]]s perhaps topped by [[Gunnel (ship element)|gunnel]]s, or some combination of the two. A [[cabin (ship)|cabin]] may protrude above the deck forward, aft, along the centerline, or covering much of the length of the boat. Vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.

The forward end of a boat is called the [[bow (ship)|bow]], the aft end the [[stern]]. Facing forward the right side is referred to as [[starboard]] and the left side as [[Port and starboard|port]].

Until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although [[Reed (plant)|reed]], bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the [[birch bark]] [[canoe]], the animal hide-covered [[kayak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Streever |first= Bill |title= Cold: Adventures in the World's Frozen Places |url= https://archive.org/details/coldadventuresin00stre |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |year= 2009 |page= [https://archive.org/details/coldadventuresin00stre/page/154 154]|isbn= 9780316042918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[coracle]] and the [[dugout canoe]] made from a single log.

By the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 [[ferro-cement]] boat construction was patented by the French, who coined the name "ferciment". This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bingham |first=Bruce |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858712 |title=Ferro-cement: design, techniques, and application. |date=1974 |publisher=Cornell Maritime Press |isbn=0-87033-178-7 |location=Cambridge, Md. |oclc=858712}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ferrocement – The World of Ferroboats |url=https://www.ferrocement.org/ |access-date=2022-12-26 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the [[Bessemer process]] ([[patent]]ed in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses and fishing fleets. Private recreational boats of steel remain uncommon. In 1895 WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by 1930 became the world's largest producer of pleasure boats.

Mullins also offered boats in aluminum from 1895 through 1899 and once again in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;WH Mullins boat history, Salem Ohio&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the mid-20th century that [[aluminium]] gained widespread popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water, allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight.

Around the mid-1960s, boats made of [[fiberglass]] (aka "glassfibre") became popular, especially for recreational boats. Fiberglass is also known as "GRP" (glass-reinforced plastic) in the UK, and "FRP" (for fiber-reinforced plastic) in the US. Fiberglass boats are strong, and do not rust, corrode, or rot. Instead, they are susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. Fiberglass structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the fiberglass encloses a lightweight core such as balsa&lt;ref&gt;.. as in the [[Iroqois]] [[catamaran]]&lt;/ref&gt; or foam.

[[Strip-built|Cold molding]] is a modern construction method, using wood as the structural component. In one cold molding process, very thin strips of wood are layered over a form. Each layer is coated with resin, followed by another directionally alternating layer laid on top. Subsequent layers may be stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous, or weighted or vacuum bagged to provide compression and stabilization until the resin sets. An alternative process uses thin sheets of plywood shaped over a disposable male mold, and coated with epoxy.

==Propulsion==
{{See also|Marine propulsion}}
The most common means of boat propulsion are as follows:
* Engine
** [[Inboard motor]]
** [[Stern drive]] (Inboard/outboard)
** [[Outboard motor]]
** [[Paddle wheel]]
** Water jet ([[jetboat]], [[personal water craft]])
** Fan ([[hovercraft]], [[air boat]])
* Man ([[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[Watercraft paddling|paddling]], [[setting pole]] etc.)
* Wind ([[sail]]ing)

==Buoyancy==
{{Main|Buoyancy}}

A boat [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] its weight in water, regardless whether it is made of wood, steel, fiberglass, or even concrete.  If weight is added to the boat, the volume of the hull drawn below the waterline will increase to keep the balance above and below the surface equal.  Boats have a natural or designed level of buoyancy.  Exceeding it will cause the boat first to ride lower in the water, second to take on water more readily than when properly loaded, and ultimately, if overloaded by any combination of structure, cargo, and water, sink.

As commercial vessels must be correctly loaded to be safe, and as the sea becomes less buoyant in brackish areas such as the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], the [[Waterline|Plimsoll line]] was introduced to prevent overloading.

==European Union classification==
Since 1998 all new leisure boats and barges built in Europe between 2.5m and 24m must comply with the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[Recreational Craft Directive]] (RCD). The Directive establishes four categories that permit the allowable [[Beaufort scale|wind]] and wave conditions for vessels in each class:&lt;ref&gt;"The Barge Buyer's Handbook" - DBA publications {{ISBN|9780953281954}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Class A - the boat may safely navigate any waters.
*Class B - the boat is limited to offshore navigation. (Winds up to Force 8 &amp; waves up to 4 metres) 
*Class C - the boat is limited to inshore (coastal) navigation. (Winds up to Force 6 &amp; waves up to 2 metres) 
*Class D - the boat is limited to rivers, canals and small lakes. (Winds up to Force 4 &amp; waves up to 0.5 metres)
Europe is the main producer of recreational boats (the second production in the world is located in Poland). European brands are known all over the world - in fact, these are the brands that created RCD and set the standard for shipyards around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cabin boats manufactured in Europe |url=https://theyachters.com/cabin-boat/ |website=theYachters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
